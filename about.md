Hi. I'm Andrei Andreev, a programmer with a ~~spider sense~~ endless quest of finding Holy Grail of programming.

I see myself as a game developer, but sometimes I dive deep into enterprise trying to find some new techniques that can be useful in gamedev.

Frequent Ludum Dare participant: usually by myself, sometimes with a company. Check out [games](/games) I've created!
