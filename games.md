I'm a game developer too, you know! Mostly I create games during Ludum Dares.

Here are games that I've made (or made in collaboration):

1. [LD-35] Shoop-da-Poop (yeah, I know~) - a game about getting in SHAPE before summer. You can see it on [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=89936).

2. [LD-36] Long Story Short - a couple of mini-games about strating off a fire. You can see it on [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=89936).

1. [LD-37] Artis@n - mix of adventure and alchemy games. You can see it on [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=89936).
